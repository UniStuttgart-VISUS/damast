// The update to GoldenLayout version 3 meant that the non-closable views lead
// to the stacks and rows/columns containing them not closing. It was not
// possible to drag away the last view in a stack, row, or column. The solution
// is to make them closable, but hide the close buttons. See also issue 233:
// https://github.com/UniStuttgart-VISUS/damast/issues/233
.lm_header .lm_close_tab {
  visibility: hidden;
  pointer-events: none;
}
