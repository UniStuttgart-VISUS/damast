<p>
  The explanations used in this documentation, and in the info texts in the visualization, use terminology and concepts from information visualization.
  We have attempted to make these texts as understandable as possible to the general public, but some understanding of the concepts used is still required.
  Here, we introduce the terms we used, and explain the visualization types.
</p>

<h3>Interactive Visualization</h3>

<p>
  Card et al. formalized the data visualization pipeline in 1998 (see <a href="https://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Visualization_Pipeline">here</a> for reference).
  This pipeline specifies the steps that data goes through from its source representation to the point where the viewer of the visualization sees it.
  The pipeline consists of four steps, in which certain operations are applied to data, transforming the data for the next step.
  After the last step, the data is present as pixels on a screen, or ink on paper.
  The pipeline allows for viewers to <em>interact</em> with each of the four steps.
  Interaction with the steps affects the end result differently.
  In general, only the last three steps are interacted with, and we will focus on these in this explanation.
</p>

<p>
  In this case, the data is already processed into a consistent, clean form, which is stored in the database.
  Through the <strong>data transformations,</strong> the <em>source data</em> is transformed into <em>data tables</em> (where <q>tables</q> means suitably structured data).
  These transformations can include general data mapping, aggregation (such as counting or averaging), and filtering (such as: only include data after the year 1,000 CE).
  By <em>applying filters</em> in the visualization or changing, for example, the <em>display mode</em> in the settings (cf. {{ full_documentation_link('settings-display-mode', 'here') }}), viewers can interact with the data transformation step.
</p>

<p>
  The data tables are then <em>mapped</em> to visual structures in the <strong>visual mapping</strong> step.
  For example, in a bar chart visualization, data items are mapped to rectangles, and the value is mapped to the height of the respective rectangle.
  In general, data attributes are mapped to <em>visual variables.</em>
  Visual variables include, but are not limited to:
  Position, length (height, width, diameter), area, shape, color value, color hue, or texture.
  Examples for interaction with the visual mappings are to switch between <em>qualitative</em> and <em>quantitative</em> mode for the timeline (cf. {{ full_documentation_link('settings-timeline-mode', 'here') }}).
  In this case, data is either mapped to rectangles of different colors, or to stacked area.
  Keep in mind that in this situation, the <em>data transformation</em> step is also affected.
</p>

<p>
  The visual structures are then <em>rendered</em> to the views.
  In this step, the <strong>view transformations,</strong> the visual perspective on the data is also modified.
  This is done via geometric transformations: translation, scaling, and rotation (although the latter is used less frequently).
  The viewer can interact with this step, for example, via zooming and panning (cf. {{ full_documentation_link('terminology-zooming-panning', 'here', true) }}).

<h4>Zooming and Panning</h4>

<p>
  <em>Zooming</em> and <em>panning</em> are two interaction types that take part in the image space of the visualization.
  However, they might still interact with other parts of the information visualization pipeline, rather than just with the view transformation step.
</p>

<h5>Zooming</h5>

<p>
  <em>Zooming</em> is the process of increasing or decreasing the scale of the visualized image.
  In a map, that means showing a smaller area of the map in more detail (zooming in), or showing a larger area in less detail (zooming out).
  In a timeline, this could mean showing a shorter time span in more detail, or a longer time span in less detail.
</p>

<p>
  In most cases in information visualization, zooming is not merely a geometrical scaling operation.
  Rather, zooming in means data can be displayed with more detail, and less aggregated.
  Similarly, zooming out, data needs to be aggregated more.
  Hence, zooming often involves not only the view transformation step, but also the data transformation and visual mapping steps, of the information visualization pipeline.
  This type of zooming is also called <em>semantic zooming;</em>
  as opposed to <em>geometric zooming,</em> which only affects the the view transformation step.
</p>

<h5>Panning</h5>

<p>
  <em>Panning</em> is the process of changing the <em>geometrical translation</em> of the visualized image.
  Panning does not affect the visual mapping, but only the view transformation.
  Some examples for panning include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Moving a map's center around, such that, for example, an area to the east is now shown.
    In maps, panning is often possible by clicking, then dragging the mouse, then releasing.
    In this case, there is no zooming involved.
  </li>
  <li>
    Moving the visible area in a timeline.
    For example, the timeline first shows the time span from 600 CE to 800 CE.
    After panning, the time span shown is from 650 CE to 850 CE;
    the timeline was panned by 50 years.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Multiple Coordinated Views</h4>

    Each view visualizes one aspect of the data, and interactions with one view are reflected in the others.

{% endif %}

<p>
  A MCV visualization (multiple coordinated views) consists of multiple <em>views.</em>
  These views are visually separated, either by just empty space between them, or by borders.
  In our visualization (see {{ full_documentation_link('fig-full-vis-screenshot', 'this screenshot', true) }}), each view is displayed in a separate UI element.
  These UI elements are called <em>panes</em> and can be resized, rearranged, or maximized; similar to how windows can be interacted with in an operating system such as Microsoft Windows.
</p>

<p>
  In an MCV, each view shows a different perspective on the <em>same data;</em>
  that is, the view visualizes a specific aspect of the data.
  In our visualization, one view (the timeline) visualizes the temporal aspect of the data, another the geospatial (the map), and so on.
  However, the same underlying data is shown in each view.
  Further, the views are <em>coordinated,</em> meaning that interaction with one of the views reflects into the other views.
  One example seen in {{ full_documentation_link('fig-full-vis-screenshot', 'this screenshot', true) }}:
  Filtering the time range in the timeline view also affects the data shown in the map view.
  Now, only the places with evidence from that time range are shown.
