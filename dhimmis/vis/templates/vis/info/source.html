<p>
This view shows the sources from which the evidence tuples were extracted.
An evidence tuple can stem from more than one source, and therefore the total sum of all source instances can be larger than the number of evidence tuples.
</p>

<h1>Contents</h1>
<p>
The view consists of a table in which each row represents one source.
The rows are sorted by descending number of evidence tuples.
</p>

<h2>Checkboxes</h2>
<p>
The first column contains a <em>checkbox</em> that toggles the visibility of evidence tuples of a source.
Keep in mind that an evidence tuple can have multiple source instances.
As long as <em>any</em> source instance's source is checked in this view, the evidence tuple will be active.
</p>

<h2>Short Names</h2>
<p>
The second column shows the short name of the source, generally an abbreviation.
The full name of the source is available via a tooltip.
</p>

<h2>Religion/Confidence Segmentation Visualization</h2>
<p>
The third column visualizes the segmentation of the evidence tuples on the religions or on the levels of confidence, depending on the <em>mode.</em>
In <em>Confidence Mode,</em> the currently selected aspect of confidence is used.
The visualization used is a normalized stacked barchart.
The width of each segment signifies the number of evidence tuples with that religion or confidence level <em>in relation to</em> the total evidence count for that source.
The total width of the bars is constant regardless of the amount of evidence tuples.
</p>

<h2>Evidence Count Visualization</h2>
<p>
The fourth column visualizes the count of evidence tuples for each source.
This column uses the same scaling in all rows, effectively creating a vertical histogram across the rows.
</p>

<h1>Interaction</h1>

<h2>Selection</h2>
<p>
Clicking on a row will <em>select</em> the source, and <em>link</em> related data in all views.
For instance, locations in the map with evidence from that source will be highlighted.
Clicking on the same row again will reset the selection.
Selecting a different row, or an element in a different view, will replace the selection.
</p>

<h2>Filtering</h2>
<p>
Sources can be filtered out from the visualized data in all views by unticking the appropriate checkbox or checkboxes.
The selection of checked sources is not applied until the <em>Apply</em> button is clicked.
Checking multiple (or all) sources works as a <em>logical disjunction,</em> that is, an evidence tuple is matched if it stems from <em>any</em> of the checked sources.
The source filters work together with filters from other views in <em>logical conjunction;</em>
for instance, if only source <em>X</em> and religion <em>Y</em> are selected in the respective views, only evidence tuples with that religion <em>and</em> source are matched.
</p>

<p>
Three additional buttons in the top right make filtering more convenient:
<dl>
  <dt><i class="fa fa-fw fa-lg fa-circle-o"></i> Uncheck all</dt>
  <dd>Uncheck all checkboxes.</dd>
  <dt><i class="fa fa-fw fa-lg fa-rotate-90 fa-exchange"></i> Invert</dt>
  <dd>
    Invert all checkboxes.
    Checked boxes are unchecked, unchecked boxes are checked.
  </dd>
  <dt><i class="fa fa-fw fa-lg fa-dot-circle-o"></i> Check all</dt>
  <dd>Check all checkboxes.</dd>
</dl>
</p>
