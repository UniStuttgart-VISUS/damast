<p>
  The <strong><em>Timeline</em></strong> shows the distribution of the different religious groups along the overall time period focused in DhiMu, i.e., 700â€“1500.
  In <em>Confidence mode</em>, the level of confidence is shown instead of religious groups (cf. the info texts of the <em>Confidence view</em> and of the <em>Settings pane</em>, respectively).
</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>
  The <em>Timeline</em> consists of two graphs, an upper and a lower one, described below.
</p>
<p>
  <!-- The following sentence needs to be checked  and rephrased after issue #39 (https://github.com/UniStuttgart-VISUS/damast/issues/39) is resolved.-->
  When <strong>hovering</strong> over the timeline, a tooltip with a summary of evidences for that year is displayed.
  When <strong>selecting</strong> data in other views, through <em>brushing and linking</em>, only the selected data shows in the timeline.
</p>
<p>
  Also, the view changes depending on the choice of <em>Show filtered data</em> in the <em>Settings pane</em>: in <em>All data</em> mode, data that is filtered out is indicated by less saturated colours.
  In <em>Only active</em> mode, data that is filtered out is hidden from the visualization in all views, including the timeline.
</p>

<h3>Upper graph</h3>
<p>
  The bigger <em>upper graph</em> shows either a qualitative summary or quantitative information, depending on <em>Timeline mode</em> selected in the <em>Settings pane</em>.
  If <em>quantitative</em> is selected, the number of evidences of that type in that year is encoded into the height of the area.
  If <em>qualitative</em> is selected, the timeline only shows whether there are evidences of that type each year.
  The colours used in the graph match the ones used in the <em>Religion view</em> or <em>Confidenc view</em>, depending on the <em>Display mode</em> selected in the <em>Settings pane</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Importantly, the upper graph can be used to filter the data according to time (cf. the section on <em>filtering</em> below).
</p>

<h3>Lower graph</h3>
<p>
  The smaller <em>lower graph</em> serves as a <q>minimap</q> or overview for the larger <em>upper graph</em>:
  if a section from the lower graph is selected by clicking and dragging, the upper graph shows only the selected timespan.
  The overview represented by the lower graph does not change while <q>zooming</q> in the upper graph.
  Vice versa, if the data is filtered by clicking and dragging in the upper graph, the selected range is indicated as a thick bar below the lower graph.
</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>

<h3>Filtering</h3>

<p>
  By <em>clicking and dragging</em> the upper graph, a time range can be selected.
  This is indicated by a rectangle, and the area outside that rectangle is displayed in less saturated colours.
  This time range serves as a time filter for the data in the entire visualization.
  Clicking anywhere in the upper graph resets the filter.
