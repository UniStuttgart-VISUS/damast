<p>
  The <strong><em>Timeline</em></strong> shows the distribution of the different religious groups along the overall time period focused in DhiMu, i.e., 700â€“1500.
  In <em>Confidence mode</em>, the level of confidence is shown instead of religious groups (cf. the info texts of the <em>Confidence view</em> and of the <em>Settings pane</em>, respectively).
</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<p>
  The <em>Timeline</em> consists of two graphs, the main timeline, and a smaller overview.
  The graphs are described in the following.
</p>

<p>
  Also, the view changes depending on the choice of <em>Show filtered data</em> in the <em>Settings pane</em>: in <em>All data</em> mode, data that is filtered out is indicated by less saturated colours.
  In <em>Only active</em> mode, data that is filtered out is hidden from the visualization in all views, including the timeline.
</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>
  The main <strong>timeline</strong> shows either a qualitative summary or quantitative information, depending on <em>Timeline mode</em> selected in the <em>Settings pane.</em>
  If <em>quantitative</em> is selected, the number of evidences of that type in that year is encoded into the height of the area as a <em>stacked area chart.</em>
  If <em>qualitative</em> is selected, the timeline only shows whether there are evidences of that type each year.
  The colours used in the graph match the ones used in the <em>Religion view</em> or <em>Confidence view,</em> depending on the <em>Display mode</em> selected in the <em>Settings pane.</em>
</p>

<p>
  Importantly, the timeline can be used to filter the data according to time (cf. the section on <em>filtering</em> below).
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
  The smaller <strong>overview</strong> serves as a <em>minimap</em> for the larger <em>timeline:</em>
  It always shows the entire time range contained in the database.
  If a section from the overview is selected by clicking and dragging, the upper timeline shows only the selected timespan, in greater detail.
  The overview represented by the lower graph does not change while <em>zooming</em> in the upper graph.
  Vice versa, if the data is filtered by clicking and dragging in the upper graph, the selected range is indicated as a thick bar below the lower graph.
</p>

<h3>Tooltips</h3>

<p>
  When <strong>hovering</strong> over the timeline and the overview, a tooltip with a summary of evidences for that year is displayed.
  If the timeline shows a smaller time range than the overview, the year in the tooltip depends on whether the mouse cursor is on the timeline or the overview.
  When <strong>selecting</strong> data in other views, through <em>brushing and linking,</em> only the selected data shows in the timeline.
</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>

<h3>Filtering</h3>

<p>
  By <em>clicking and dragging</em> the timeline, a time range can be selected.
  This is indicated by a rectangle, and the area outside that rectangle is displayed in less saturated colours.
  This time range serves as a time filter for the data in the entire visualization.
  Clicking anywhere in the timeline resets the filter.
