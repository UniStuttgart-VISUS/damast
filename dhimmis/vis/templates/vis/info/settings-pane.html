<p>
  In this view, different settings and features can be controlled.
</p>

<h1>Visualization Settings</h1>

<p>
  These are settings that directly affect the visualization.
  In particular, they control which data is shown, and in what way.
</p>


<h2>Show filtered data</h2>

<p>
  This switch controls if data not matching the currently selected filters is also visualized.
  If <em>All data</em> is selected, non-matched data is represented by less saturated colors.
</p>

<h2>Display mode</h2>

<p>
  This switch controls which aspect of the data is mapped to color.
  If <em>Religion</em> is selected, religion is used for coloring, using the color scheme in the <em>Religion view</em>.
  If <em>Confidence</em> is selected, the level of confidence is used, using the color scheme in the <em>Confidence view</em>.
  The <em>Aspect of Confidence</em> used can be selected in the <em>Confidence view</em> as well; there, the currently used aspect is indicated with an
  <i class="fa fa-eye"></i> eye symbol below the column.
</p>

<h2>Timeline mode</h2>

<p>
  This switch controls whether the timeline shows a qualitative summary or quantitative information.
  If <em>Quantitative</em> is selected, the number of evidences of that type in that year is represented by the height of the area.
  The timeline then looks like a <em>stacked area chart</em>.
  If <em>Qualitative</em> is selected, the timeline only shows <em>whether</em> there are evidences of that type each year.
  The timeline then looks like a <em>Gantt chart</em>.
</p>

<h2>Map mode</h2>

<p>
  This switch controls whether symbols are <em>clustered</em> or <em>unclustered</em>.
  By default, symbols are clustered: zooming out will lead to religions attributed to different places being <q>summarized</q> according to ###.
  If symbols are unclustered, one small symbol per place and religion is shown.
  This mode may lead to overlap of symbols when zooming out even to a relative small scale and should thus be used with due caution when interpreting the results.
</p>

<h1>Generate Report</h1>

<p>
  With this feature, a detailed text report of all the data visible according to the currently selected filters can be generated.
  The report will also contain information on the filter criteria that led to the selection of data.
  This report will show up in a new tab.
  A report can also be created by uploading a <em>visualization state</em> that was safed and downloaded beforehand (see below).
  Be careful not to do this with very broad filter criteria, as the report will get very long in that case.
</p>

<p>
  This section also has a button labeled <em><q>Describe filters.</q></em>
  Clicking this button will open a modal window within the visualization that describes the currently active filters in text form.
  This description is the same as at the top of a generated report.
</p>


<h1>Layout Settings</h1>

<p>
  You can save the current layout.
  This setting will only persist for your current browser and computer (using <code>localStorage</code>).
  You can also reset to the initial layout (<em>Note:</em> this will reload the page).
</p>


<h1>Persist State</h1>

<p>
  Also, the current state of the visualization can be saved.
  In particular, this will save the <em>filters</em> you currently have applied, the center point, zoom level, and visible layers of the <em>map</em>, and the <em>visualization settings</em> applied above.
  These settings are <span class="no-break"><i class="fa fa-download"></i> <em>downloaded</em></span> as a file to the computer.
  Later, such a file can be <span class="no-break"><i class="fa fa-upload"></i> <em>uploaded</em></span> to restore the state.
  What is more, that file can be shared to either present oneâ€™s results or to generate a report based on the filters (cf. also ###).
