<h2>Visualization Settings</h2>

<p>
These are settings that directly affect the visualization.
In particular, they control which data is shown, and in what way:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Show filtered data</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    This controls if data which does not match the currently selected filters is also visualized.
    If <em><q>All data</q></em> is selected, non-matched data is represented by less saturated colors.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Display mode</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    This controls which aspect of the data is mapped to color.
    If <em><q>Religion</q></em> is selected, the religion is used for coloring, using the color scheme in the <strong>Religion</strong> tab.
    If <em><q>Confidence</q></em> is selected, the level of confidence is used, using the color scheme in the <strong>Confidence</strong> tab.
    The <em>aspect of confidence</em> used can be selected in the <strong>Confidence</strong> tab as well, and the currently used aspect is indicated with an
    <i class="fa fa-eye"></i>
    eye symbol below the column.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Timeline mode</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    This switch controls whether the timeline shows a qualitative summary or quantitative information.
    If <em><q>Quantitative</q></em> is selected, the number of evidences of that type in that year is encoded into the height of the area.
    The timeline then looks like a <em>stacked area chart.</em>
    If <em><q>Qualitative</q></em> is selected, the timeline only shows <em>whether</em> there are evidences of that type each year.
    The timeline then looks like a <em>Gantt chart.</em>
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Map mode</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    This switch controls whether the map shows large, detailed symbols for clusters of location without overlap, or one smaller symbol per place.
    The latter mode may lead to overlap of symbols and should be used at one's own peril.
    </p>
  </dd>
</dl>


<h2>Generate Report</h2>

<p>
You can generate a detailed text report of all the data visible under the currently selected filters.
The report will also contain information on the filter criteria that lead to the selection of data.
This report will show up in a new tab.
You can also create a report by uploading a <em>visualization state</em> (see below) you have exported.
Be careful not to do this with very broad filter criteria, as the report will get very long in that case.
</p>

<p>
This section also has a button labeled <em><q>Describe filters.</q></em>
Clicking this button will open a modal window within the visualization that describes the currently active filters in text form.
This description is the same as at the top of a generated report.
</p>


<h2>Layout Settings</h2>

<p>
You can save the current layout.
This setting will only persist for your current browser and computer (using <code>localStorage</code>).
You can also reset to the initial layout (<em>Note:</em> this will reload the page).
</p>


<h2>Persist State</h2>

<p>
You can also save the current state of the visualization.
In particular, this will save the <em>filters</em> you currently have applied, the center point, zoom level, and visible layers of the <em>map,</em> and the <em>visualization settings</em> applied above.
These settings are <span class="no-break"><i class="fa fa-download"></i> <em>downloaded</em></span> as a file to your computer.
You can <span class="no-break"><i class="fa fa-upload"></i> <em>upload</em></span> such a file later to restore the state.
You can also submit that file to generate a report based on the filters later on.
</p>
