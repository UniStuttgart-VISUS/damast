  This view shows different settings and features.
</p>

<h3>Visualization Settings</h3>

<p>
  These are settings that directly affect the visualization.
  In particular, they control which data is shown, and in what way.
</p>


<h4>Show filtered data</h4>

<p>
  This switch controls if data not matching the currently selected filters is also visualized.
  If <em>All data</em> is selected, non-matched data is represented by less saturated colors.
</p>

<h4>Display mode</h4>

<p>
  This switch controls which aspect of the data is mapped to color.
  If <em>Religion</em> is selected, religion is used for coloring, using the color scheme in the <em>Religion view</em>.
  If <em>Confidence</em> is selected, the level of confidence is used, using the color scheme in the <em>Confidence view</em>.
  The <em>Aspect of Confidence</em> used for the visualization can be selected in the <em>Confidence view</em>; there, the currently used aspect is indicated with an
  <i class="fa fa-eye"></i> eye symbol below the column.
</p>

<h4>Timeline mode</h4>

<p>
  This switch controls whether the timeline shows a qualitative summary or quantitative information.
  If <em>Quantitative</em> is selected, the number of evidences of that type in that year is represented by the height of the area.
  The timeline then looks like a <em>stacked area chart</em>.
  If <em>Qualitative</em> is selected, the timeline only shows <em>whether</em> there are evidences of that type each year.
  The timeline then looks like a <em>Gantt chart</em>.
</p>

<h4>Map mode</h4>

<p>
  This switch controls whether symbols are <em>clustered</em> or <em>unclustered</em>.
  By default, symbols are clustered: zooming out will lead to religions attributed to different places being <q>summarized</q>.
  (Note that for these <q>summaries</q>, all places are treated equally; e.g., the distribution of religions of place A and place B is combined without taking into account any further aspects of A or B.)
  If symbols are unclustered, one small symbol per place and religion is shown.
  This mode may lead to overlap of symbols when zooming out even to a relative small scale and should thus be used with due caution when interpreting the results.
</p>


<h3>Generate Report</h3>

<p>
  With this feature, a detailed text report of all the data visible according to the currently selected filters can be generated.
  The report will also contain information on the filter criteria that led to the selection of data.
  This report will show up in a new tab.
  A report can also be created by uploading a <em>visualization state</em> that was safed and downloaded beforehand (see below).
  It is discouraged to create a report with very broad filter criteria, as it will become very long and thus difficult to handle.
</p>

<p>
  This section also has a button labeled <em>Describe filters</em>.
  Clicking this button will open a small window (a so-called modal window) within the visualization that describes the currently active filters in text form.
  This description is the same as the one at the top of a generated report.
</p>


<h3>Layout Settings</h3>

<p>
  The current layout of the visualization, i.e. the arrangement of the views, can be saved.
  This feature is only possible if the option <em>All cookies</em> is accepted in the <em>Cookie preferences</em> (accessible through the menu bar on top).
  The settings will only persist for the currently used browser and computer (using <code>localStorage</code>).
  Note that, depending on your browser settings, cookies can be deleted after closing the browser losing the saved settings.
  In this case, the <em>Persist state</em> feature (see below) can be used as an alternative.
</p>
<p>
  You can also reset the layout to the initial state. Note that this will reload the page.
</p>


<h3>Persist State</h3>

<p>
  Also, the current overall state of the visualization can be saved.
  In particular, this will save
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <em>filters</em> that are currently applied,</li>
  <li>the center point, zoom level, and visible layers of the <em>map</em>, and</li>
  <li>the <em>visualization settings</em> applied above.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These settings are <span class="no-break"><i class="fa fa-download"></i> <em>downloaded</em></span> as a file to the computer.
  Later, such a file can be <span class="no-break"><i class="fa fa-upload"></i> <em>uploaded</em></span> to restore the state.
  What is more, that file can be shared to either present oneâ€™s results or to (re-)generate a report based on the filters.
</p>
