  \caption{Backend system structure: The Flask server runs in a Docker container, and a single directory from the host system is exposed to the container as a volume. This directory contains configuration and logging files. The PostgreSQL database can be anywhere, but usually runs on the same host as a Docker image. If the Flask server does not manage its own SSL certificates, an nginx server handles incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests as a reverse proxy.}
