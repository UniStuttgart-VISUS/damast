respective views, or the header bar, as well. Add a detailed evidence list
page for the place URI page.


2022-05-12                                            1.1.3+hotfix-wasm-csp

Add a CSP that fixes the WASM clustering code not being loaded in newer
Windows Chromium builds (Edge and Chrome, >=101), and thus the map glyphs
never appearing in the visualization.


2022-05-05                                                           v1.1.3

Incorporated the new home page design and contents. Fix an issue where

Remove necessity for Rust toolchain when building Damast. Fix a bug with
loading a visualization state with a complex religion filter. Fix a bug
with brushing and linking sometimes not matching the filtered data. Other
minor fixes. Improve navigation and page layout on longer pages. Add
sorting options to the source view: by name or evidence count. Centralized
the configuration, made configuration via JSON file possible.


2022-04-01                                                           v1.1.0

Add navigation ARIA labels where appropriate. Warn about changed underlying
data in re-created evicted reports by adding data version history to the
report database. Ignore "modifier letter left/right half ring" for place
name sorting. The source list is now sorted alphabetically as a second key,
after evidence count. Rename the main Python package and all configuration
and environment variables from "dhimmis" to "damast". Various changes to
the report format regarding sorting, placement of footnotes, and the like.


2022-02-09                                                           v1.0.5

The server can now be configured to evict old reports. Evicted reports can
still be retrieved from the filters, but the report contents need to be
regenerated on demand. Alternative names for places are now sorted first
by language, then by transcription and name. The place URI page and reports
now contain a "How to Cite" section. The annotation suggestion refresh jobs
can now be configured as to whether and how often they run, and can be
triggered manually. Minor CSS source file restructuring. Fix internal
GitHub dependencies to point to public repositories. Fix a bug with
incorrect match sources on place search. Fix a bug with the time filter not
being shown correctly in the overview timeline. Fix a vulnerable npm
dependency (CVE-2021-23566).


2022-01-18                                                           v1.0.4

The set of map tiles provided as base layers in the maps (visualization,
GeoDB-Editor, and place URI page) can now be configured. A default set is
provided. The religion hierarchy view now uses HTML input elements and has
some quality-of-life additions, such as a revert button, subtree toggling,
and consistent control icons to the rest of the views. Tag view tooltips
now also show a short description, if it exists in the database table. Add
a first version of a general visualization documentation page. Fixes a bug
where the timeline tooltip would be incorrect over the overview when zoomed
in to a shorter time range.


2022-01-12                                                           v1.0.3

Added functionality to define which roles a visitor (i.e., not logged in)
will receive via a environment variable. Updated and fixed some of the unit
tests to work properly with the cookie policies introduced in v0.19.8.


2022-01-10                                                           v1.0.2

Jinja2 templates can now be selectively overridden in an external
directory, for example to replace the impressum or title page. External
static files can also be hosted. Fixes PEP495 warnings from apscheduler.
Fixes an issue with loading map states with non-integer zoom levels. Users
that are not allowed to see the GeoDB-Editor now have links to the place
URI pages from the visualization location list instead. Adds a button to
restore the default confidence selection in the visualization confidence
view. Remove some historical clutter and naming.


2021-12-28                                                           v1.0.1

Updated default map center and zoom level to better match public dataset
extent. Cleaned up and documented clustering radius constants. Renamed the
navigation link to the visualization to "Visualization" (from "Prototype"),
and renamed references in the sources to "vis" also.


2021-12-21                                                           v1.0.0

Bump version to 1.0.0 for public release. Remove some historical clutter,
update README files and documentation.


2021-12-21                                                         v0.19.12

The HTML report and report list now contain a link to the visualization,
with the report UUID in the URL fragment. The visualization will evaluate
the fragment, and if it consists of a valid UUID to an existing report,
apply the filters from that report on load.


2021-12-15                                                         v0.19.11

Updated all view infoboxes in the visualization to provide a complete and
up-to-date summary of the views' purposes and functionalities. Update
dependencies, and make the development server run in a modified Docker
environment that exposes the server source files. The diversity overlay in
the map now shows the correct diversities even for densely populated areas.


2021-12-09                                                         v0.19.10

Use colored map symbols for the report maps. Cycle through a set of shapes
to ensure differentiability of religions, as colors can be quite similar.
Place sets are now actually used in the report.


2021-12-08                                                          v0.19.9

The server version is now stored directly in the report filter JSON and the
visualization state JSON. The visualization now also accepts to load only
the filter JSON stored on report generation, in which case the rest of the
state will remain unchanged. Report generation now properly fails if no
evidences match the current criteria. Place set filters are now listed in
the query description of reports.


2021-12-08                                                          v0.19.8

More strict IP-Logging, add Cookie and localStorage consent functionalities
to comply with GDPR rules.


2021-12-07                                                          v0.19.7

Smaller bugfixes. All exceptions and errors during runtime are now logged
to the error log.


2021-11-25                                                          v0.19.6

The location list now shows how the current location confidence filter
affects the locations, and also what location confidence they have. The
location list now also has a filtering functionality, where a place set can
be specified. Place sets can also be saved in the database.


2021-11-09                                                          v0.19.5

Update the title page content.


2021-11-09                                                          v0.19.4

Speed up unittests, make server more resilient to the number of reverse
proxies it lies behind.


2021-11-02                                                          v0.19.3

Add CHANGELOG to repository and to server.


2021-11-02                                                          v0.19.2

Improve evidence REST endpoint to reduce the number of HTTP requests
sent when opening the GeoDB-Editor.


2021-11-02                                                          v0.19.1

Improve the way messages from the server, such as "Log-in successful",
are rendered into the page, and how they are removed after a few seconds.


2021-11-02                                                          v0.19.0

This release restructures the user/role mapping of the server
considerably.  Until now, there was a general "user" role that could do
most things, and some additional specialty roles with higher privileges.
The new system has roles with three aspects:

 - General access level: "user", "dev", and "admin".
 - Database access: "readdb" and "writedb", where reading access to the
   database is differentiated from writing access.
 - Access to different functionalities: "vis", "geodb", "annotator",
   "reporting", and "pgadmin".

The respective unit tests and test fixtures were also modified to reflect the
new structure, and a few new test users were created for different role
combinations.


2021-10-22                                                         v0.18.10

Make recalculation of annotation suggestions dependent on whether anything
changed since the last calculation.


2021-10-22                                                          v0.18.9

Existing annotation documents are now regularly scanned for potential
annotation suggestions.  For this, existing names of places, persons,
and religions are considered, as well as existing annotations in the
same document.  The suggestions are displayed separately in the annotator,
and can be taken on as new annotations in two clicks.

This release also fixes some issues with the PDF report regarding
connected text in Arabic names, as well as LTR/RTL mixing issues.


2021-10-11                                                          v0.18.8

Add a PDF version of the report, using LaTeX.  As report creation now
takes longer, reports are created in separate processes.  The PDF version
is also retrievable using the UUID of the report.


2021-10-04                                                          v0.18.7

HTML documents for annotation are now sanitized on upload.  The annotator
page now contains documentation about how to prepare the document.


2021-09-30                                                          v0.18.6

Creating a report now also creates a PDF map, using pyplot.  Each report
now gets a UUID, and reports can be retrieved later on as long as they are
persisted on the server.  Reports are now stored in a SQLite3 database,
and the size limitation on how many evidences are included in the report
is removed.  The report generation is done asynchronously now, and the
result page shows a spinner during this time.  A separate page lists
all reports the user can see.


2021-09-29                                                          v0.18.5

Move the entire server stuff into a Docker container.  The container is
built and can then be deployed easily to new hosts as a TAR file using
"docker save" and "docker load".


2021-09-24                                                          v0.18.4

The advanced religion filter in the visualization is now performed
client-side.  This simplifies some code both in the server and the
front end.  The infobox text and the filter verbalization were updated.


2021-09-21                                                          v0.18.3

Add place search functionality to the place URI endpoint.


2021-09-20                                                          v0.18.2

Add a place endpoint which shows data about only the place.  This will
later be used for the place URIs.


2021-09-17                                                          v0.18.1

Add map mode without clustering.  This mode shows smaller icons with
one circle for each religious denomination, with the circles arranged
in a hexagonal grid pattern.  The map icons can overlap in this mode,
and the mode is stored in the visualization state.


2021-09-16                                                         v0.17.13

Minor improvements to visualization.


2021-09-16                                                         v0.17.12

Minor improvements to GeoDB-Editor.


2021-09-16                                                         v0.17.11

Minor fixes to GeoDB-Editor.


2021-09-13                                                         v0.17.10

Use the qualitative timeline by default.  Show the placed locations
before the unplaced by default.


2021-09-01                                                          v0.17.9

Add functionality to describe the currently active filters from within
the visualization.  This re-uses the same text that is shown in the
report as well.


2021-08-31                                                          v0.17.8

Make the WASM clustering code for the map an external dependency:
https://github.tik.uni-stuttgart.de/frankemx/wasm-clustering


2021-08-30                                                          v0.17.7

Clean up and fix some minor issues with the timeline.


2021-08-27                                                          v0.17.6

Add a qualitative timeline.  Instead of showing a quantitative stacked
area chart for the number of evidences per religion (or confidence
level) for each year, this shows a Gantt chart of whether or not there
are evidences in that year for each religion (or confidence level).
The timeline mode is also stored with the visualization state.


2021-08-26                                                          v0.17.5

Clean up database dump compression.


2021-08-23                                                          v0.17.4

Clean up server configuration.


2021-08-20                                                          v0.17.3

Add GeoJSON polygon filters to the visualization.  These restrict the
geographical locations of the evidence shown.  The filters are also
described in and applied to the reports.


2021-08-19                                                          v0.17.2

Misc fixes and tweaks.  Add linking of evidence from annotator to
GeoDB-Editor.


2021-08-19                                                          v0.17.1

Implement new annotator feature.  The annotator has the functionality
to add annotations of different types to digital documents, and to link
together such annotations to evidences.  This version also includes
functionality to upload new documents for annotations, as well as an
extensive documentation.  It is now also possible to edit the positions of
existing annotations.

Add reporting functionality.  This generates a textual description of the
filters applied to the data, and lists the places, religions, persons,
and evidence matching those filters in the database.

Add some quality-of-life features to the visualization, such as row- and
column-wise selection and deselection of confidence levels.  Split up
the GeoDB-Editor to show a separate page for person-related tables.
Add links between visualization, GeoDB-Editor, and annotator.


2021-06-11                                                          v0.16.3

2021-06-01                                                          v0.16.2

Cleanup, bug fixes, locale-aware location list sorting.


2021-05-18                                                          v0.16.1

Add a settings pane to the visualization.  This pane provides the
functionality for saving and loading visualization states.  Further,
the layout of the GoldenLayout tiles can be saved in localStorage.


2021-05-10                                                          v0.15.6

Make "no value" for confidence selectable in GeoDB-Editor tables.


2021-05-06                                                          v0.15.5

Smaller tweaks and fixes.


2021-04-14                                                          v0.15.4

Add more person table functionality to GeoDB-Editor.


2021-04-13                                                          v0.15.3

Add external place and person URIs, add person columns and tables to
GeoDB-Editor.


2021-04-07                                                          v0.15.2

More unit tests, tweaks to REST endpoints.

Improve search for place names, tweak and add unit tests.


2021-04-07                                                          v0.15.0

Better name search for places with non-Latin scripts.  Here, the reverse
