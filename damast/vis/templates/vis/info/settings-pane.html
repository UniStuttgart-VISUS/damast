<p>
  This pane shows different <strong>settings</strong> pertaining to the visualization.
  It also offers some <strong>functionalities</strong> to store or load these settings and to generate reports from the currently shown data.
</p>

<section id="settings-vis-settings">
<h3>Visualization Settings</h3>

<p>
  These are settings that directly affect the visualization.
  In particular, they control which data is shown and in which way.
</p>


<article id="settings-all-data-only-active">
<h4>Show filtered data</h4>

<p>
  This switch controls if data is visualized although it <strong>does not match the currently applied filters.</strong>
  If <em>All data</em> is selected, non-matched data is shown in less saturated colors.
  Otherwise, it is not shown at all.
</p>
</article>

<article id="settings-display-mode">
<h4>Display mode</h4>

<p>
  This switch controls <strong>which aspect of the data</strong> is mapped to color.
  If <em>Religion</em> is selected, religion is used for coloring, using the color scheme in the <em>religion view.</em>.
  If <em>Confidence</em> is selected, the level of confidence is used, using the color scheme in the <em>confidence view.</em>
  The <em>aspect of confidence</em> used for the visualization can be selected in the <em>confidence view;</em>
  there, the currently used aspect is indicated with an <i class="fa fa-eye"></i> eye symbol below the column.
</p>
</article>

<article id="settings-timeline-mode">
<h4>Timeline mode</h4>

<p>
  This switch controls whether the <em>timeline</em> shows <strong>a qualitative summary or quantitative information</strong>.
  If <em>Quantitative</em> is selected, the number of pieces of evidence of that type in that year is represented by the height of the area.
  The <em>timeline</em> then looks like a <em>stacked histogram.</em>
  If <em>Qualitative</em> is selected, the <em>timeline</em> only shows <em>whether</em> there are pieces of evidence of that type each year.
</p>
</article>

<article id="settings-map-mode">
<h4>Map mode</h4>

<p>
  This switch controls whether map glyphs are <strong><em>clustered</em> or <em>unclustered.</em></strong>
  By default, glyphs are <em>clustered:</em>
  zooming out will lead to religions attributed to different places being <em>clustered</em> (<q>summarized</q>).
  (Note that for these clusters, all places are treated equally;
  for example, the distribution of religions of place A and place B is combined without taking into account any further aspects of A or B.)
</p>
<p>
  If glyphs are <em>unclustered,</em> one small symbol per place and religion is shown.
  <em>Note:</em> This mode may lead to overlap of symbols when zooming out even to a relative small scale and should, thus, be used with due caution when interpreting the results.
</p>

<h3>Generate Report</h3>

<p>
  With this feature, a detailed <strong>text report</strong> can be generated, which presents all data matched by the currently applied filters.
  The report will also contain information on the filter criteria that led to the selection of data.
  After clicking <em>Generate report,</em> a new tab in the browser will open.
  A report can also be created by uploading a <em>visualization state</em> that was saved and downloaded beforehand (see {{ full_documentation_link('settings-persist-state', 'below', true) }}).
  More about reports can be found on the <a href="{{ url_for('root-app.root') }}" target="_blank">start page</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em> It is not advised to create a report with very broad filter criteria, as it will become very long and thus difficult to handle.
</p>

<p>
  This section also has a button labeled <em>Describe filters.</em>
  Clicking this button will open a small window (a so-called modal window) that describes the currently active filters in text form.
  This description is the same as the one at the top of a report.
</p>


<h3>Layout Settings</h3>

<p>
  The <strong>current layout</strong> of the visualization; i.e., the arrangement of the views, can be saved.
  This feature is only available if the option <em>All cookies</em> is accepted in the <em>Cookie preferences</em> (accessible through the menu bar on top).
  The <em>layout settings</em> will only persist for the currently used browser and computer (using <code>localStorage</code>).
  You can also reset the layout to the initial state. Note that this will reload the page.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em> Depending on your browser settings, cookies may be deleted after closing the browser, which leads to the loss of the saved <em>layout settings.</em>
</p>


<article id="settings-persist-state">
<h3>Persist State</h3>

<p>
  With this feature, the current <strong>overall state</strong> of the visualization can be saved.
  In particular, this will save
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <em>filters</em> that are currently applied,</li>
  <li>the center point, zoom level, and visible layers of the <em>map,</em> and</li>
  <li>the <em>visualization settings</em> (cf. {{ full_documentation_link('settings-vis-settings', 'above', true) }}).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These settings are <span class="no-break"><i class="fa fa-download"></i> <em>downloaded</em></span> as a file to the computer.
  Later, such a file can be <span class="no-break"><i class="fa fa-upload"></i> <em>uploaded</em></span> to restore the state.
  The file can also be shared to either present your results or to (re-)generate a report based on the filters.
</p>
